# Body Mass Index(BMI) Calculator
# The formula for calculating a person's body mass index is to divide their weight(kg) by their height in meters squared. Let's now look at how to build a BMI calculator in Python.
def calculate_bmi(weight, height):
    # Calculate BMI using the formula
    bmi = weight / (height ** 2)
    return bmi

# Input weight and height from the user
weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kg: "))
height = float(input("Enter your height in meters: "))

# Calculate BMI
bmi = calculate_bmi(weight, height)

# Display the result
print(bmi)

# Categorize the BMI
if bmi < 18.5:
    print("You are underweight.")
elif 18.5 <= bmi < 24.9:
    print("You have a normal weight.")
elif 25 <= bmi < 29.9:
    print("You are overweight.")
else:
    print("You are obese.")
